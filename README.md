This research investigates integrating web scraping with Consumer Price Index (CPI) data to enhance real-time inflation forecasting. It utilizes ARIMA, SARIMA, Prophet, XGBoost, LSTM, and exponential smoothing techniques, combining web-scraped data with traditional CPI indicators. Results demonstrate improved accuracy and timeliness of inflation predictions by leveraging diverse online sources. Advantages include near real-time data collection and integration of alternative sources like news and social media. Challenges such as data quality and legal/ethical considerations are addressed through rigorous preprocessing. The study underscores the potential of this approach for real-time inflation forecasting, advocating further research for model refinement and ethical exploration in economic forecasting and policy analysis.
